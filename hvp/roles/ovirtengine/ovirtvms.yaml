# Ansible playbook for automated oVirt VMs creation
# Note: Thanks to Simone Tiraboschi for initial Ansible oVirt management hints
# TODO: find a way to extract minimum desired parameters from local Kickstart file and use those for vm creation in loop
# TODO: find a way to create a vm from scratch (including disks and nics) and make it boot once from network with Kickstart installation (on-the-fly configure PXELinux on installer machine using pre-defined MAC address)
# TODO: remove all PXELinux custom menu files (/var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/01-*) at the end
